## `Decentralized File Storage.`

### Welcome to the New World of File Storage & Sharing

    -- This app uses IPFS to store your files in a de-centralized secure file storing network

    -- The files are mapped with the Ethereum Wallet Account that approved the transaction

    -- This ensures no other account can view/tamper with the documents on another account

    -- The contracts are written in Solidity Language, and tested and deployed using Ganache and Truffle Framework

    -- The tests are written using Chai Framework

    -- The Client Side app is written using React.JS
